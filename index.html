<h2>TimeWise</h2>

<p>TimeWise will consist of multiple timers that will ultimatly allow you to keep track of a certain amount of time so you can stay on track.</p>
<p>TimeWise will be using VisualCode Studios to create and write the code for this appplication while using different languages in the code.</p>

<ul class="a">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>

</ul>

<p>TimeWise was a given idea from the start and has not been changed the whole proposal, therefore the last change to the proposal was 23rd of October.</p>

<p>TimeWise will idealy be a well made timer for the user as well as include other features like:</p>
<ol class="c">
  <li>10 minute timer</li>
  <li>5 minute timer</li>
  <li>3 minute timer</li>
  <li>2 minute timer</li>
  <li>1 minute timer</li>
  <li>30 second timer</li>
  </ol>

<p> Some features TimeWise would love to see but might not get around to would include:
</p>

<ol class="d">
  <li>Random Number generator between 1-5</li>
  <li>Random Name generater from everyone in class</li>
</ol>

<p> TimeWise will be using Basic Technical Features learned in class like:
</p>

<ol class="e">
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Selection</li>
  <li>Sequence</li>
</ol>

<p> For now, TimeWise will not require any Advanced Technical Features in order to operate.
