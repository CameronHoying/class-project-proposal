<h2>TimeWise</h2>
<p> Contact information: Cameron Hoying, Cameronphoying@lewisu.edu
<p>TimeWise will consist of multiple timers that will ultimatly allow you to keep track of a certain amount of time so you can stay on track.</p>
<p>TimeWise will be using VisualCode Studios to create and write the code for this appplication while using different languages in the code.</p>

<ul class="a">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>

</ul>

<p>TimeWise was a given idea from the start anf has under gone mutiple changes throughout the course from October 23rd. The last changes made to the proposal was on November 19th.</p>

<p>TimeWise will idealy be a well made timer for the user as well as include other features like:</p>
<ol class="c">
  <li>10 minute timer</li>
  <li>5 minute timer</li>
  <li>3 minute timer</li>
  <li>2 minute timer</li>
  <li>1 minute timer</li>
  <li>30 second timer</li>
  </ol>

<p> Some features TimeWise would love to see but might not get around to would include:
</p>

<ol class="d">
  <li>Random Number generator between 1-5</li>
  <li>Random Name generater from everyone in class</li>
</ol>

<p> TimeWise will be using Basic Technical Features learned in class like:
</p>

<ol class="e">
  <li>Loops</li>
  <li>Selection</li>
  <li>Sequence</li>
</ol>

<p> Now that Time-Wise has been finished, the timer has been made. Time-Wise finihs product consists of a time input where the user can adjust how many hours, minutes, or seconds the time is set to, then the clokc will start when the user clicks start. when the time stops or the user is done, the user can click restart to start the timer again. if i had more time i would maybe change the color to change the closer you get the 0.
